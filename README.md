Hangman game in spanish
This is a simple command line hangman game that uses words that were fetched from dictionaries at https://github.com/sbosio/rla-es.
On this version, the player can choose difficulty. However, spanish is already a difficult language, so even in first level of difficulty it's still hard to guess.
